This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by chnaranj

## Description
NetPractice is a set of 10 small networking exercises. Each level shows a broken IPv4 network diagram, and the goal is to adjust the configuration so that all required hosts can communicate correctly through routers and gateways.

## Instructions
1. Download the archive provided on the project page and extract it.
2. Open index.html in a  web browser (for example, Google Chrome).
3. Enter your 42 login in the interface.
4. Solve levels 1 to 10 by fixing the network configuration; use **Check again** to verify your answers.
5. For each level, click **Get my config** to export your configuration file.
6. Submission: place the 10 exported configuration files (one per level) at the **root** of this Git repository.

## Resources
Main networking concepts involved in this project:
- IPv4 addresses and TCP/IP addressing  
- Subnet masks, networks and subnets  
- Default gateway and basic routing between networks  
- Role of routers and switches in small networks  
- OSI layers at a high level  
- Binary (bitwise) reasoning on IP addresses and ranges  

AI usage:
- I used AI tools to get explanations about what IP addresses, subnet masks, networks and subnets are, and how to approach calculations using bits and address ranges.
- I also used NotebookLM to generate podcast-style explanations about these networking topics.
- All final configurations and answers for the 10 levels were understood, decided, and entered manually in the NetPractice training interface.
